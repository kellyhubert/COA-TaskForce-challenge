Description:
    This HTML code represents a responsive photo gallery webpage.
    It includes a DOCTYPE declaration, an HTML root element, and a head element.
    The head element contains meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings, as well as a title for the webpage.
    It also includes a link to an external CSS file named "styles.css".

    The body element contains a div element with the class "gallery", which serves as the container for the photo gallery.
    Inside the "gallery" div, there are multiple "photo" divs, each representing a photo in the gallery.
    Each "photo" div contains an image element, an overlay div, a caption, a sub-caption, a "know more" button, and a "details-text" div.
    The "photo" divs also have a "data-details" attribute that provides additional details about each photo.

    After the "gallery" div, there is another div with the id "lightbox" that represents a lightbox for displaying enlarged images.
    It contains a close button, an image element for displaying the enlarged image, and a caption element for displaying the caption of the image.

    Finally, the HTML code includes a script tag that links to an external JavaScript file named "script.js".

    This code is part of the COA-TaskForce-challenge project and is located in the file "Gallery.html".
